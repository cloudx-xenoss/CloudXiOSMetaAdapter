```ruby
pod CloudXMetaAdapter

## üß∞ Project Configuration / Troubleshooting

**1. Linker Flags**  
Add the following to your project‚Äôs Other Linker Flags in Build Settings:  
`-ObjC`

**2. Enable Objective-C Exceptions (Recommended)**
- Some older versions of Meta SDKs expect Obj-C exceptions to be enabled.
- Go to Build Settings
- Set Enable Objective-C Exceptions (GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS) to YES


**3. App Transport Security (ATS)**  
If your app communicates with non-HTTPS servers for ads (less common), update your Info.plist to allow exceptions:  
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: Only do this if absolutely necessary.*


**4. NSUserTrackingUsageDescription (iOS 14+)**  
If your app targets iOS 14+, and you want access to the IDFA, you must add a usage description in your Info.plist:
```
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>
```

**5. Minimum Deployment Target**  
üì± As of recent versions, Meta SDK requires iOS 11.0+. Set this in your project‚Äôs deployment target.


**6. Bitcode (Optional)**  
üö´ Meta SDK does not support Bitcode. If you're running into issues during archive or validation, disable Bitcode:  

Go to your target ‚Üí Build Settings ‚Üí Set **Enable Bitcode** to `NO`.
