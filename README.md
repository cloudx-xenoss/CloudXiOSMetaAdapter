## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 CocoaPods

Meta adapter for CloudX SDK is available though [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```ruby
pod 'CloudXMetaAdapter'
```

Install the pod from command line using:
```bash
pod install --repo-update

## ✨ Automatic Features

The CloudX Meta adapter automatically handles:

- ✅ **App Tracking Transparency Integration**: Automatically configures Meta's Advertiser Tracking Enabled (ATE) flag based on your app's ATT permission status
- ✅ **Bid Token Generation**: Creates Meta bidder tokens for programmatic auction participation  
- ✅ **Server Reward Validation**: Supports Meta's server-side reward validation for rewarded ads
- ✅ **iOS 14.5+ Compatibility**: Full support for App Tracking Transparency requirements
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring ad performance

**No additional configuration required** - the adapter integrates seamlessly with CloudX Core SDK's tracking services.

## 🧰 Project Configuration / Troubleshooting

**1. Linker Flags**  
Add the following to your project’s Other Linker Flags in Build Settings:  
`-ObjC`

**2. Enable Objective-C Exceptions (Recommended)**
- Some older versions of Meta SDKs expect Obj-C exceptions to be enabled.
- Go to Build Settings
- Set Enable Objective-C Exceptions (GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS) to YES


**3. App Transport Security (ATS)**  
If your app communicates with non-HTTPS servers for ads (less common), update your Info.plist to allow exceptions:  
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```
⚠️ *Note: Only do this if absolutely necessary.*


**4. NSUserTrackingUsageDescription (iOS 14+)**  
If your app targets iOS 14+, and you want access to the IDFA, you must add a usage description in your Info.plist:
```
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>
```

**5. Minimum Deployment Target**  
📱 As of recent versions, Meta SDK requires iOS 11.0+. Set this in your project’s deployment target.


**6. Bitcode (Optional)**  
🚫 Meta SDK does not support Bitcode. If you're running into issues during archive or validation, disable Bitcode:  

Go to your target → Build Settings → Set **Enable Bitcode** to `NO`.
